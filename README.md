The Fisher's Iris Data Set:

Iris is a very popular garden plant, genus of 260-300 in the family of Iridaceae taking it's name from the Greek word for rainbow.

The British statisticial Ronald Fisher first introduced the Iris flower Data Set, in 1936, which consists of 50 samples of three Iris species  (Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor) and measures four features of each sample: the length and the width of sepals and petals in cm. 

Fisher wanted to distinguish the similar species from each other by developing and using a discriminant and cluster analysis. This analysis aims in finding a linear combination of features that relates or distinguishes two or more classes of objects.

This probably is one of the most famous databases, used in data mining, classification and clustering analysis and to to test algorithms.
