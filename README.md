The Fisher's Iris Data Set:

Iris is a very popular garden plant, genus of 260-300 in the family of Iridaceae taking it's name from the Greek word for rainbow.

The British statisticial Ronald Fisher first introduced the Iris flower Data Set, in 1936, which consists of 50 samples of three Iris species  (Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor) and measures four features of each sample: the length and the width of sepals and petals in cm. 

Fisher wanted to distinguish the similar species from each other by developing and using a discriminant and cluster analysis. This analysis aims in finding a linear combination of features that relates or distinguishes two or more classes of objects.

This probably is one of the most famous databases, used in data mining, classification and clustering analysis and to to test algorithms.

Question 1:
I start writing my code by importing pandas and numpy packages.
I searched online and found that I could import the the iris data set from sklearn.datasets. 
I attribute the data in variable x as I will be later using the name data for the final dataframe.
I save the following variables to clean my data:
target: {ndarray, Series} of shape (150,)
names = target_names: list (The names of target classes)
I save my dataframe as data using my x variable and columns as feature_names(The names of the dataset columns.) I attribute the target into the column species of my dataframe and then in species column we are replacing the number with the corresponding iris type.

I print the first 10 rows to make sure my data as are expected and I save the file in excel.

Question 2:
I save the above data frame in excel and I add to my repository.

Question 3.1:
I use the decribe function to create a summary statistics of my data and save it to variables_summary.
I'm then importing sys package and I'm saving the file into a writtable text file. After searching, I found out the sdout function (standard output stream) that enables the print function not only to be written to the display but instead to send text to a location called the standard output stream (redirect to a specific file).

#3.2: Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and 

I import matplotlib and seaborn packages as I will need them to create my histograms.

I play with my data frame and I set index as species so it'll be easier for me to filter. I split my dataframe into 3 smaller ones - one for each iris type and I name the files as of the type name.

For each iris type I use the plt.hist function, set the parameters and create a histogram and save it in png file.
However, while searching I came across the FacetGrid function which allows me to create a histogram for each of my variables (filtering by hue) which is very cleaned, organized and looks great!

Our findings are in line with the bibliography and references.
